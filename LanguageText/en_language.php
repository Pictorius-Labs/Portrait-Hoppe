        Sculpture classes can be arranged by appointment for a variety of groups with different levels of experience: 
        <br />
        - Sculpture in soapstone and Baumberger sandstone for children and adolescents
        <br />
        - Sculpture for schools/school projects 
        <br />
        - Sculpture for adults with and without prior knowledge
        <br />
        <br />
        In my classes, we learn the basic tasks involved in sculpting. Everyone who has experience with modeling can add and take away material; in sculpting, material is simply chipped away. Thus, finding the form of the sculpture requires more precision. I also attach particular importance to practicing sculptural techniques that will allow even beginners to enjoy the course to the end.",
